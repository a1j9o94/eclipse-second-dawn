Scenario: Research tier 1 technology with no prerequisites
  Given Alice has 5 science resources
  And Alice has not researched any technologies yet
  When Alice researches "Advanced Mining"
  Then "Advanced Mining" is added to Alice's technology list
  And Alice's science resources are reduced by 5
  And Alice immediately gains +1 material income per controlled sector
  And the technology appears in Alice's player dashboard

Scenario: Cannot research technology without prerequisites
  Given Bob has 8 science resources
  And Bob has not researched any tier 1 technologies
  When Bob attempts to research "Fusion Drive" (requires "Advanced Propulsion")
  Then the research action is rejected
  And an error message displays "Prerequisites not met: Advanced Propulsion required"
  And Bob's science resources remain unchanged
  And the technology is not added to Bob's list

Scenario: Research technology with multiple prerequisites
  Given Carol has researched "Advanced Labs" and "Quantum Computing"
  And Carol has 10 science resources
  When Carol researches "Singularity Core" (requires both techs)
  Then "Singularity Core" is added to Carol's technology list
  And Carol's science resources are reduced by 10
  And Carol gains the technology's benefits

Scenario: Research technology that unlocks new ship parts
  Given Dave has 6 science resources
  And Dave has researched "Advanced Weapons"
  When Dave researches "Plasma Missiles"
  Then "Plasma Missiles" appears in Dave's available ship parts
  And Dave can now equip Plasma Missiles when upgrading ships
  And the ship upgrade UI shows the new part option

Scenario: Technology tree shows correct availability
  Given Alice is viewing the technology tree
  And Alice has researched "Advanced Propulsion" and "Improved Hull"
  Then all tier 1 technologies are shown as available
  And tier 2 technologies requiring "Advanced Propulsion" are highlighted
  And tier 2 technologies requiring other tier 1 techs are shown as locked
  And tier 3 technologies are shown as locked
  And each technology displays its cost and prerequisites clearly
